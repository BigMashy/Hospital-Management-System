This is a hospital management system, I am very new to python and so I realise a lot of this may be wrong. I intend to fix this code, however I cannot pinpoint problems due to the circular import. 
PROBLEM: Circular import, appears to be between admin.py and main.py, I have used ai to try and help me with this problem however I can not find a solution. 
This is for a university project, and so any help with this issue can help me get back to working on it.
